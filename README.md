# simple_boilerplate

## Description

simple_boilerplate is a modern web application built with Next.js, offering secure authentication and a smooth user experience. This project serves as a robust foundation for developing complex web applications with integrated authentication features. This boilerplate is still in development, but the main branch works perfectly. Several other features will be added soon.

## Features

- User authentication with support for Credentials, Google, and more
- Protected routes with authentication middleware
- Dark and light theme toggle

## Main Libraries

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for web application development
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) - Authentication solution for Next.js
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - ORM for Node.js and TypeScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed superset of JavaScript

## Additional Dependencies

- [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/) - Icon library for React
- [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) - Theme management for Next.js
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Collection of reusable and customizable React components
- [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) - TypeScript-first schema validation library
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - Performant library for form management in React

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm, pnpm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/romain-sanieres/simple_boilerplate.git
   cd simple_boilerplate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   # or
   yarn install

   ```

3. The default authentication database for Prisma is configured for PostgreSQL. For other Prisma schemas, or if you are using a different type of database, you can check the 
   Schema section here: https://authjs.dev/getting-started/adapters/prisma

4. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add the necessary variables for authentication.

   Connect your database with url
   - DATABASE_URL

   You can use `npx auth secret` to create an auth secret
   - AUTH_SECRET

5. Generate Prisma:

   ```bash
   pnpx prisma generate
   pnpx prisma db push
   ```

6. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

8. Configure protected routes:
   Make sure to add your private routes in the `middleware.ts` file to ensure they are properly protected by authentication. For example:

   ```typescript
   export const config = {
     matcher: ["/dashboard", "/profile", "/api/private"],
   };
   ```

   This will ensure that only authenticated users can access these routes.

## Project Structure

- `app/` - Contains application components and pages
- `components/` - Reusable components
- `auth.ts` - Authentication configuration
- `db.ts` file is used to configure and manage the connection to your database. Make sure to import this file in any files where you need to access the database.
- `middleware.ts` - Middleware for route protection
